# Yolov5s_Malaria_Detection
This project implements a deep learning pipeline using YOLOv5 for the real-time detection of malaria parasites from blood smear images. The model was trained and tuned on a curated microscopy dataset to assist in early, automated screening for malaria in low-resource clinical settings.
